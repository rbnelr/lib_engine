DONE:
 
 Got static linking of GLFW working
 -> have to compile as C as seperate .o/.obj file/s
 -> fastest complie (while always rebuilding all code) is to include all .c files into one .c file and compile that to a seperate .o/.obj file and link it to the main object
 -> unused function stripping works, ~90KB executable
 
TODO
-FEATURES:
 
 implement shader loading
 -probably will need $include command in shader
 
 implement cubemap skybox instead of clear color
 -generate this cubemap with a shader
 -write a nice looking skybox generator shader (try to look like a sky)
 
-BUGS:
