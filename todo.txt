DONE:
 
 Got static linking of GLFW working
 -> have to compile as C as seperate .o/.obj file/s
 -> fastest complie (while always rebuilding all code) is to include all .c files into one .c file and compile that to a seperate .o/.obj file and link it to the main object
 -> unused function stripping works, ~90KB executable
