DONE:
 
#2017.11.23 do. abend
 Got static linking of GLFW working
 -> have to compile as C as seperate .o/.obj file/s
 -> fastest complie (while always rebuilding all code) is to include all .c files into one .c file and compile that to a seperate .o/.obj file and link it to the main object
 -> unused function stripping works, ~90KB executable

 -write a nice looking skybox generator shader (try to look like a sky)
  -add sun
 
 simple way of doing dynamic tweak variables
 -overlayed text editor to allow tweaking in fullscreen
  -> might easaly become easier to use and more flexible than external text format
